                                The structure of my website is simple: a navigation bar and a body frame. 
                                <br>For the <b>navigation bar</b>, I created button to navigate to different webpages.
                                <br>For the <b>body frame</b>, I first put an image and align it to the center of the box. After that, I created a table with one row and two columns, the first one is for the title (e.g. About) and the second for the description.
                                <br>I made sure that I adjusted the paddings so that the text wouldn't stick to the edge of the box
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                I have nothing much to comment about how I choose the css selector for an element. Although most of my elements are unique, I included both attribute 'id' and 'class' in the assignment.
                                Specifically, 'class' attribute is used for the wrapper, while the 'id' is used for the internal element of a wrapper such as headers. 
                            </p>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                            <h2> Aesthetic quality </h2>
                            <em><span>Axiom: Everything that is related to Violet Evergarden is beautiful regardless.</span></em>
                            
                            <h3>Font</h3>
                            My inspiration for this website is the anime Violet Evergarden, so the theme is a letter. 
                            I intended to choose an older, hand-writing font for the content in the webpages for the sake of theme illustration; however, it would be distracted if all the word are stylish, so I just used 'Luminari, fantasy' font for the headers and the buttons. 
                            <br>
                            <h3>Color</h3>
                            Throughout the pages, I chose beige or light yellow as theme colors to match the background.
                            The button in the navigation bar are painted with white and violet colors since they are *somehow* constrast and not contrast the theme color. Another reason is that they represent characteristic of the protagonist in the theme anime.
                            <h3>Structure</h3>
                            I rounded the corner the buttons and the body frame so that they won't look edgy. I also used the shadow effect to make they look more beautfiul
                            
                    </p>

                            <h2>Accessibility</h2>
                            <p>
                                I made my website simple as much as possible with a navigator bar located to the top left of the page like many other websites.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My website is also friendly for blinded people as I didn't use much graphical objects, and all the images are noted with 'alt' attribute so that they can be read by voiceover.
                                This feature may also support people with low-spec computers.
