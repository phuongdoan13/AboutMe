                        To begin with, I had no experience with coding in general before I came to UTS.

                        My first experience with computer was when I was 5. 
                        My father taught me how to use a Windows PC to do some basic stuff such as word processing (I didn't even know how to read back then) and playing game. 
                        Is Road Rash suitable for a kid? Haha. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I began to be curious about how those wonderful applications and determined to become a computer expert (or whatever they call) to understand the underlying mechanism of this weird box-shaped tool.
                        And finally, with the support of my beloved parents, I laid the first stone of my dream at UTS when I turned 18. I'm truly grateful that I was granted this precious chance &#128149; *sob* *sob*.

                        During my first year, I met a lot of wonderful people. The <span>senpai</span> that I endorse the most what my teammates in NetEz (trust me, it isn't ez), who taugtht me the true spirit a team member must have.

                        Some programming languages I learned during my first year:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Python: I used this for Data Analysts project and competitions</li>
                            <li>SQL: same as Python</li>
                            <li>Java: I love OO stuff</li>
                            <li>R: just for fun</li>
                            <li>HTML + CSS: second year actually, not really my cup of tea</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
